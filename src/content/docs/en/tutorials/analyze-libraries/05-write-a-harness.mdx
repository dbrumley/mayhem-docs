<PreCheck>
 - Write a new test harness.
 - Add the new test harness to the build.
 - Run the new test harness. 
</PreCheck>

So far you've been working with the existing code base. In this step we'll a
new test harness.

## What is a test harness?

:::warning [Nomenclature]
There are different definitions and terms for essentially the same thing.
In dynamic analysis literature the process of building a new test, including
writing a test driver, writing mocks, and so on is called **harnessing** and the
resulting code a **harness**.  

In software testing, "harnessing" is the same process as writing a new test. The International Software Testing Qualifications Board
([ISTQB](https://www.istqb.org/))  would call the **harness* a **test**.

TL;DR - A **test** in software testing is the same as a **harness* in dynamic
analysis.
:::

In testing you check a single input for a single output, e.g.,:
```c
assert(factorial(3) ==6); 
```

Mayhem, like most dynamic analysis, store inputs in a file rather than embedded
directly in the code.  In order to test a new function, you will need to:
1. Read an input from a file
2. Call any library setup
3. Call the function under test
4. Perform any needed library teardown.

## What should you harness?

When harnessing a library, the first thing to target is the libraries public
API. These are functions a user can directly call, and testing and security
checks help ensure that downstream users can use the published API without
problem.

::: tip[How much to harness]
The best-tested libraries have a harness for each public API member a
user could call.  
:::

Right now the `xmltest.cpp` file only tests `LoadFile`. 
```cpp "doc->LoadFile( argv[1] );"
// xmltest.cpp
	if ( argc > 1 ) {
		XMLDocument* doc = new XMLDocument();
		clock_t startTime = clock();
		doc->LoadFile( argv[1] );
		clock_t loadTime = clock();
		int errorID = doc->ErrorID();
		delete doc; doc = 0;
		clock_t deleteTime = clock();

		printf( "Test file '%s' loaded. ErrorID=%d\n", argv[1], errorID );
		if ( !errorID ) {
			printf( "Load time=%u\n",   (unsigned)(loadTime - startTime) );
			printf( "Delete time=%u\n", (unsigned)(deleteTime - loadTime) );
			printf( "Total time=%u\n",  (unsigned)(deleteTime - startTime) );
		}
		exit(0);
	}
```

## Writing a new test harness

Write a new test harness for `NewText`.

Here is a template:
```cpp
// test_newtext.cpp
#include "tinyxml2.h"
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/uio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

using namespace tinyxml2;

int main( int argc, const char ** argv )
{
  char buf[10240];

  int rc = read(0, &buf, sizeof(buf));
  // Add code to call NewText

  exit(0);
} 

```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```diff lang="cpp"
// test_newtext.cpp
#include "tinyxml2.h"
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/uio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

using namespace tinyxml2;

int main( int argc, const char ** argv )
{
  char buf[10240];

  int rc = read(0, &buf, sizeof(buf));
+  XMLDocument doc;
+  XMLElement* textNode = doc.NewElement("text");
+  XMLText* versionText = doc.NewText(buf);
+
+  textNode->InsertEndChild(versionText);
+  doc.InsertEndChild(textNode);
+
+  XMLPrinter printer;
+  doc.Print();
  
  exit(0);
} 
```
</details>

## Adding the harness to the build

The next step is to integrate the harness into the overall build. Can you change the build to include building the harness?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```diff lang="cmake"
// CMakeLists.txt
add_executable(test xmltest.cpp)
add_dependencies(test tinyxml2)
add_dependencies(test ${TARGET_DATA_COPY})
target_link_libraries(test tinyxml2)

+ add_executable(test_newtext test_newtext.cpp)
+ add_dependencies(test_newtext tinyxml2)
+ target_link_libraries(test_newtext tinyxml2)
```

You then need to rebuild with the new file: 
```bash
cmake --build build   # reconfigure and rebuild
```
</details>




## Running the new harness

TBD.
