<Lede> Let's harness ntpq, a popular XML library.  </Lede>

In this example, you'll harness
[ntp-4.2.2](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ntp_spool/ntp4/ntp-4.2/ntp-4.2.2.tar.gz)
and reproduce CVE-2009-0159.


There are three main steps for harnessing any library or application:
1. Identify what functions to harness
2. Create and build harnesses for library functions
3. Create an initial test suite corpus

Creating and building the harness is the same as writing a new test.  It
involves:
1. Create a driver that reads input from a file
2. Write any initialization or setup code
3. Call the function(s) under test
4. Create mocks real objects that you cannot use (or do not want to use)
5. Perform any necessary teardown, such as freeing memory.

You will be writing a harness that finds CVE-2015-8317. 

## Check out and build the code

Download the code directly from
[https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ntp_spool/ntp4/ntp-4.2/ntp-4.2.2.tar.gz](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ntp_spool/ntp4/ntp-4.2/ntp-4.2.2.tar.gz).
.  

Then build just the `ntpq` directory:
```bash
make -C ntpq
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Compile with `afl-clang-fast`</summary>
You can compile the program by setting `CC` (the compiler variable) with:
```bash
CC=afl-clang-fast ./configure && AFL_HARDEN=1 make -C ntpq
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>Figure out how to call the `cookedprint` function</summary>
</details>

<details> 
<summary>Hint 2: Use existing code as your harness template</summary>
Rather than trying to have afl's output simulate a remote ntpd, just replace
`ntpq/ntpq.c:main()` function with code that calls `cookedprint` with `datatype`,
`status`, and `data` all read in from stdin, and the output file as stdout.
