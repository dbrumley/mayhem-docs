<Lede> In this tutorial, you'll learn how Mayhem can help you check library code by
finding real historical bugs in [tinyxml2](src/tinyxml.tgz) ðŸš€.   </Lede>

TinyXML2 is a simple, small, and efficientC++ XML parser that is widely used in
industry. You will learn how to reproduce bugs found in 2.0.1. 

Along the way, you'll:
* Create a test driver for tinyxml2
* Dockerize the library and the test driver
* Analyze the code with Mayhem
* Reproduce the bugs Mayhem finds on your own system

Want to preview the solution? You can view the final project on [GitHub](TBD). 


:::note
If you are new to Mayhem, we recommend you go through the [code
tutorial](code-tutorial) first.

You check them off!

At the end of each page, you'll find a clickable checklist of tasks you should
now be able to do. Check these items off to see your progress in the Tutorial
Tracker. 

Using the tracker is optional, but it can help you remember your place if you
complete the tutorial over multiple visits. You can also leave some checklists
blank as a reminder of units that you want to revisit later.
