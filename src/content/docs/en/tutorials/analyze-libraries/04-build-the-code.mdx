<PreCheck>
 - Build the code.
 - Run the included test driver. 
</PreCheck>



From now on we will assume you are in the tutorial code directory
`analyze-libraries-tutorial`.  

## Build the code

Our first major step is to make sure you can
build the code.  

```bash
cmake -B build   # Create a build directory with source in the current directory

make -C build    # Use make specifying the build directory

cmake --build build    # Alternatively, build with cmake

```

<details>
<summary>I tried building with `make` and it failed. Help!</summary>

There are two common problems.

1. You don't have a C++ compiler installed. If you are on Linux, you will need
   to install the appropriate package, such as `build-essential` on Debian and
   Ubuntu.
2. You ran `make` from the project root directory. You run `cmake` in the project root
   directory, but then switch to the **build** directory to run `make`. 

The default `Makefile` may not work for you, and that's why we are
using the `cmake` process.

:::tip[What compile commands ran?]

You can set up `make` to show you each command it executed to build the source
by adding `VERBOSE=` to your command line:
```bash 
cmake -B build
make -C build VERBOSE=1
```

<details>
<summary>Want to set verbose as the default option?</summary>
You can add `-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON` to make this permanent for the
`make` command:
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON -S . -B build
make
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>What something machine-parsable?</summary>  
You can create a `compile_commands.json` file
with: 
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 # 
cmake --build build   
```
`compile_commands.json` can be read by downstream tools like [CodeCompass](https://github.com/Ericsson/CodeCompass).

:::

## Run a test
The source code includes a test application called `test`.  Let's make sure it
runs!

```bash
# From the `build` directory, run ./test
./test
[pass] Example-1 [0][0]
[pass] Example-2 [0][0]
Name of play (1): A Midsummer Night's Dream
Name of play (2): A Midsummer Night's Dream
[pass] Example-3 [0][0]
Both values are the same: 2 and 2
[pass] Example-4 [1][1]
<element/>
...
```
Great job! Making sure you can build the application is often over half the job
when retrofitting application security into a legacy or existing project.
