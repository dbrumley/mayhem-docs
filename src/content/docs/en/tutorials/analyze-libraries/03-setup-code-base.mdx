<Lede>Let's get started improving tinyxml2-2.0.1!</Lede>

Now that you know what we're going to improve and have all the dependencies
installed, it's time to make sure you can build the software. 

:::tip[Always check you can compile first]
The first thing  you should always do when adding any new analysis is make sure
you know how to build the software. It can take some time when working
with a new code base, so be patient with yourself.  
:::

## Fork the initial repository

As you write code, you will be periodically committing your changes to
GitHub, and ultimately setting up your CI/CD pipeline to automatically run a
security analysis pipeline. A fork in Git is simply a copy of an existing
repository in which your changes are your own and disconnected from the
original developers.  

Your first step is to fork our [sample
repository](https://github.com/ForAllSecure/analyze-libraries-tutorial) on
GitHub.  You should be able to see your fork at
**https://github.com/USERNAME/analyze-libraries-tutorial** (using your own
USERNAME) when complete. 

## Clone your repository

Once you've created a fork, you need to download it to your local machine.
This is called "cloning" the repository. To do so, run:

```bash
# Clone the repository. Make sure you use your own USERNAME
git@github.com:<USERNAME>/analyze-libraries-tutorial.git 

# Enter the code directory
cd analyze-libraries-tutorial 
```
