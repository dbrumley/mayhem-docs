 - Install the tools that you need to build tinyxml2. 
</PreCheck>

<Lede>Let's make sure your system is set up.</Lede>

## Get the developer tools you need

### Terminal

You will use a **command line (terminal)** to build and modify tinyxml2. 

You can access the command line through a local terminal program for your
operating system. Common applications include **Terminal** (MacOS/Linux) and
the **Command Prompt** (Windows). One of these will
probably already be on your machine.  

If you are using Windows, we recommend you use [WSL to install Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) unless you
are already very familiar with C++ development on Windows. That will allow you
to follow along with the Linux tutorial on your windows machine. 


### C++ compiler

For tinyxml2 to build, you will also need to have a C++ compiler installed on
your system.  In particular, we recommend that you install clang because it has
additional optimizations that speed up dynamic analysis.

You will also need to install `cmake`, which is used as the tinyxml software
build tool. 

On Debian and Ubuntu systems, you can install these requirements with:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential clang cmake
```

### Debugger

A debugger will help you identify the root cause of bugs and vulnerabilities.
On Debian and Ubuntu systems, you can install gdb with:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y gdb
```

:::tip[gdb pro tip!]
You can start `gdb` on a command line, including arguments, right from the
shell. Many people do not know how to start gdb on an application that takes
arguments. Suppose you run the program with `./test --foo blah`:
```bash
# Efficient!
gdb --args ./test --foo blah

# Inefficient. 
gdb ./test
set args --foo blah
```
:::

### Code Editor

Additionally, you will need to download and install a **code editor** to write
your code.

:::tip[We'll use...]
This tutorial will use **VS Code**, but you can use any editor for your
operating system.  For example, if you are use to `vim` make sure you have it
installed with `sudo apt-get install -y vim`.
:::

### Git

As you write code, you will be periodically committing your changes to
GitHub, and ultimately setting up your CI/CD pipeline to automatically run a
security analysis pipeline.

We will be using `git` as part of this tutorial. Make sure you have it
installed on your system. 

On Linux, run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y git
```
