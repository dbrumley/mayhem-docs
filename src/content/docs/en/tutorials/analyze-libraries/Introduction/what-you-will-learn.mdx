<Lede> If you have a basic understanding with **C** and the **UNIX CLI**, you are
ready to go. </Lede>

You will also need a [GitHub](https://github.com) (or similar) account for
integrating your project into CICD. 


The steps we will be going through are:
1. Create a git project for the library and your modifications
2. Verify you can build the library
3. Identify what functions to harness
4. Create and build harnesses for the identified functions
5. Dockerize the library with your harnesses
6. Create an initial *seed* test suite corpus
7. Write a Mayhemfile
8. Analyze the library with Mayhem
9. Reproduce Mayhem findings on your local machine
10. Integrate the library and your harness into CI/CD


<details>
<summary>What is a harness? Why do I have to write them?</summary>

Your code often relies on third-party libraries, but they are not stand-alone
applications. In order to use an application library, you need to write code
that:
1. Initializes the library
2. Calls functions you want to test
3. Performs any necessary teardown

The above steps are exactly what you would write to perform any software
testing or dynamic analysis. Performing these steps is commonly called "harnessing" in security. 
Libraries are not stand-alone applications.

<details>
<summary>Can I start with existing unit tests?</summary>

Absolutely!  Unit tests are a great place to start.

Mayhem and the underlying technologies such as fuzzing and symbolic execution
are a generalization of testing.  A typical unit test takes exactly one input
and tests for one output. You test for multiple inputs by writing multiple
tests.

For example, if we have the factorial function we might write three unit tests
by hand: 
```c
EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
```

Mayhem generalizes unit testing by checking
[program properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_testing).  Without
any configuration, Mayhem checks for runtime errors that raise signals, such as
divide by zero and `assert` failures.

One of the cool things about dynamic analysis is you can inline your own
security property in the same language the program is written in. This is
important because it allows you to co-develop what security you want with your
application.  Tools that use a separate DSL (domain specific language) put the
security requirements outside the code, which is more fragile and error prone.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What sort of security properties can Mayhem check?</summary>

Mayhem performs dynamic analysis, and can check any **enforceable security
property**.  This set of properties is very general, and is [very precisely
defined](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/EnfSecPols.pdf). At a high
level, any property that can be checked at execution time is an enforceable
security property.
