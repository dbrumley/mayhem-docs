“Yak shaving” (or “shaving a yak”) refers to a task, that leads you to another
task, that leads you to another, and so on. The term was coined by Carlin
Vieri, an MIT PhD, in the 90s.  

These tips and tricks are designed to help you save time yak shaving. 

## Create a development docker image and use it

Creating a docker image that contains your commonly used tools can save you
time. Once you define the image, you can reuse it multiple times on multiple
projects.

Here is a good starter:

```Dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM debian:stable-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential \
  gdb vim less libc6-dbg valgrind afl++ libfuzzer-16-dev file curl \
  python-is-python3 python3-pip python3.11-venv \
  meson cmake ninja-build pkg-config autoconf automake libtool
RUN bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gef.blah.cat/sh)"
RUN echo "export LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8" >> /etc/bash.bashrc
WORKDIR /build
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

### Building the image
Here is how you might build it, substituting `mayhem` for your own [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/)
username. 
```bash
# Build for x86/x64, which is technically called amd64. 
docker build --platform=Linux/amd64 -t mayhem/dev:amd64 . # Build for x86/x64/amd64 
docker push mayhem/dev:amd64   

# Optional: build for ARM, such as on an M1 mac
docker build --platform=Linux/aarch64 -t mayhem/dev:arm . 
docker push mayhem/dev:arm

# Tag your default architecture as latest
docker tag mayhem/dev:amd64 mayhem/dev:latest
docker push mayhem/dev:latest
```

### Using the image

Suppose you have checked out your project in the current directory. You can
mount this within the docker container to get access to your dev tools, while
also ensuring all changes are reflected locally.

To do so, run:
```bash
# -v `pwd`:/build mounts the current directory into /build in the container
# -ti runs an interaction shell
docker run -v `pwd`:/build  -ti mayhem/dev bash
```
