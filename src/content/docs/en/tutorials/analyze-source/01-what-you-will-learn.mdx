<Lede> If you have a basic understanding with **C** and the **UNIX CLI**, you are
ready to go. </Lede> 

You will also need a [GitHub](https://github.com) (or similar) account for
integrating your project into CICD. 

You will learn how to systematically add dynamic analysis and fuzzing to
your code in the following bite-sized chunks: 
1. Set up your system
2. Set up the code base
3. Build the library code
4. Create and build harnesses 
5. Create an initial test suite (aka corpus)
6. Dockerize everything
7. Run with Mayhem
8. Reproduce Mayhem findings on your local machine
9. Integrate the library and your harness into CI/CD
10. Optimize performance

## Concepts

People who understand the underlying concepts report the easiest ability to
adopt dynamic analysis like Mayhem.  Here is a quick tutorial.


### What is a harness? 

A harness is simple a test driver that runs the library in the intended way. Mayhem analysis, fuzzing, and other dynamic analysis all require you write a
test harness. Test harnesses have three steps:
1. **Setup:** Call any needed library initialization code.
2. **Test:** Calls the functions you want to test
3. **Teardown:** Free any resources set up during testing.

In the dynamic analysis community the above steps are called "harnessing".  Harnessing, just like testing, enables dynamic analysis to focus on specific
code of interest.   

### Why are there zero false positives? 

You may have heard about false positives when running analysis. A false
positive occurs when the analysis says something about the program under test
that is untrue. False positives are a constant and unavoidable problem in
static analysis. 

In dynamic analysis, the program under test is the running harness. Mayhem
always produces a *test case* that demonstrates defects in the running harness.
You can think of the test case as a Proof of Vulnerability (POV). 


> Garbage in, garbage out.

Of course if your test framework is garbage, the results are also garbage. The zero false positive guarantee works just the same as with unit tests.  Each
time you run a unit test you are checking whether the code as written behaves
as intended.  If the test fails, you don't say the test has a false positive;
that wouldn't make sense. Instead, it's garbage in, garbage out.  So it's
important to make sure your test harnesses are correctly running the code, just
like you would with a unit test.


### How does Mayhem differ from unit testing? 

Mayhem and the underlying technologies such as fuzzing and symbolic execution
are a generalization of testing.  A typical unit test takes exactly one input
and tests for one output.  For example, if we have the factorial function we might write three unit tests
by hand: 
```c
EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
```

Mayhem generalizes unit testing by checking
[program properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_testing).
Under-the-hood, Mayhem is running fuzzing, symbolic execution, dynamic bug
triage, and a host of another analysis together to provide you the best
security testing experience.  

Without any configuration, Mayhem checks for runtime errors that raise signals, such as
divide by zero and `assert` failures. But it doesn't stop there. 


### What sort of security properties can Mayhem check?

One of the cool things about dynamic analysis is you can inline your own
security property in the same language the program is written in. In fact,
developers do this every day with `assert` statements. 

Technically, you can write and check code for any  **enforceable security
property** with Mayhem.  This set of properties is very general, and is [very precisely
defined](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/fbs/publications/EnfSecPols.pdf). Just
about any security analysis you want -- from business logic to injection
attacks -- is an enforceable security property. 

### Is fuzzing random?

This is a common misconception, and to be fair, a large number of experts
informally will make this mistake.  A more correct statement is that fuzzing is
a randomized algorithm. However, many intelligent algorithms are randomized
while not being "dumb random". 

The original paper that coined the term "fuzzing" used purely random inputs. In
fact, one could argue it was simply randomized testing (which was well known at the time)
rebranded. 

However, since then significant advances have been made. Modern fuzzers like
AFL++ and libfuzzer use advanced feedback-driven algorithms to generate new
inputs. For example, AFL++ and libfuzzer use features such as `cmp`
instructions to more intelligently check programs. 


### Does type safety make dynamic analysis unnecessary?

No!  The purpose of fuzzing in type-safe languages is to prevent runtime
exceptions from vulnerabillities.  In fact, type-safe languages like Go and Rust have adopted fuzzing as a
key part of how they do security.  

Why?  Type safety is only one part of
writing a safe program.  At a high level, type safety says that if the program
is well-typed, then each step of execution is safe **or the program will
terminate with an exception**.  We call this preservation (a step in a
well-typed program is well-typed), and progress (a well-typed program takes a
step, or is finished if there is no such step). In the world of security, this means
vulnerabilities still exist, but the type system prevents certain ways of
exploiting vulnerabilities like control flow hijack.

Fuzzing can root out those bugs that result in runtime errors proactively. 

### Where is a good place to start when I'm analyzing 3rd party code?

Existing unit tests and sample applications are the best place to start.  In
fact, many google tests can be turned into harnesses with very little
modification.

## Check your knowledge

1. Type safety prevents all vulnerabilities.
 <MultipleChoice>
   <Option>True</Option>
   <Option isCorrect>False</Option>
 </MultipleChoice>

 <details>
 <summary>Explanation</summary>
 Type safety does not mean that the code is bug or vulnerability free. For example, the application may still have errors that cause runtime problems.Box
 </details>

2. Harnessing requires the same steps as writing a unit test.
<MultipleChoice>
   <Option isCorrect>True</Option>
   <Option>False</Option>
 </MultipleChoice>

 <details>
 <summary>Explanation</summary>
 Harnessing is just like writing a unit test. The only difference is that instead of asserting a single input has a single output, you check a program property.
 </details>

3. Mayhem is a fuzzer.
<MultipleChoice>
   <Option>True</Option>
   <Option isCorrect>False</Option>
 </MultipleChoice>

 <details>
 <summary>Explanation</summary>
It is correct to say Mayhem has a fuzzer in the Box. However, Mayhem performs a suite of additional dynamic analysis, such as backtrace analysis, triage, and symbolic execution.
