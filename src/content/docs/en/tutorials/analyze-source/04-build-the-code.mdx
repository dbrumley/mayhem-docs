 - Build the code.
 - Run the included test driver.

<Lede>The first big milestone is always building the code!</Lede>


From now on we will assume you are in the tutorial code directory
`analyze-libraries-tutorial`.  

## Build the code

Our first major step is to make sure you can
build the code.  

```bash
cmake -B build      # Create a build directory with source in the current directory
cmake --build build # Run the configured build, make in this case.
```

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between `make -C build` and `cmake --build build`?</summary>
`cmake --build build` is a more abstract, tool-agnostic way to invoke the build
process, providing portability and simplicity.  It will work even if the underlying configured tool is `ninja`, `make` or something else.

In this particular case, though, `cmake` is configured to use `make`. So you
could also run `make -C build`, it would just be less "generic".

<details>
<summary>I tried building and it failed. Help!</summary>

There are two common problems.

1. You don't have a C++ compiler installed. If you are on Linux, you will need
   to install the appropriate package, such as `build-essential` on Debian and
   Ubuntu.
2. You ran `make` from the project root directory. You need to run the build
   relative to the `build` directory.  That is what `cmake --build build` does,
   or equivalently `make -C build`.

:::tip[What compile commands ran?]

You can set up `make` to show you each command it executed to build the source
by adding `VERBOSE=` to your command line:
```bash 
cmake --build build -- VERBOSE = 1 # or equivalently make -C build VERBOSE=1
```

<details>
<summary>Want to set verbose as the default option?</summary>
You can add `-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON` to make this permanent for the
`make` command:
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>What something machine-parsable?</summary>  
You can create a `compile_commands.json` file
with: 
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1  
cmake --build build   
```
`compile_commands.json` can be read by downstream tools like [CodeCompass](https://github.com/Ericsson/CodeCompass).

:::

## Run a test
The source code includes a test application called `test`.  Let's make sure it
runs!

```bash
# From the `build` directory, run ./test
./test
[pass] Example-1 [0][0]
[pass] Example-2 [0][0]
Name of play (1): A Midsummer Night's Dream
Name of play (2): A Midsummer Night's Dream
[pass] Example-3 [0][0]
Both values are the same: 2 and 2
[pass] Example-4 [1][1]
<element/>
...
```
Great job! Making sure you can build the application is often over half the job
when retrofitting application security into a legacy or existing project.
