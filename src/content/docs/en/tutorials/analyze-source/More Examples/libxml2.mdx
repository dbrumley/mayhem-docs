<Lede> Let's harness libxml2 and find CVE-2015-8317! </Lede>


## Get and build the code

In this example, you will reproduce CVE-2015-8317.  We'll need to check out the
version of the code that has this vulnerability, and then build it. 

We're going to build with AFL so that we can test our harnesses locally. After
we run them locally, we'll integrate everything into Mayhem and CI/CD.

First, clone the repository and check out the correct version:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:GNOME/libxml2.git
cd libxml2            
git checkout 726f67e  # Code at this point contains CVE-2015-8317
```

Second, build the code with AFL by setting the `CC` environment variable to
`afl-clang-fast`, a wrapper for the clang compiler. We'll also be telling the
wrapper to build [ASAN instrumentation](/en/concepts/security-policies), and to
disable python. We're disabling python because the vulnerable version depends
on some python 3.8 and before idiosyncrasies.


```bash
CC=afl-clang-fast ./autogen.sh --without-python  # create and run ./configure
AFL_USE_ASAN=1 make -j 4         # Build with ASAN using up to 4 cores
```

:::tip[ASAN finds more bugs!]
We are setting `AFL_USE_ASAN` as an environment variable to enable ASAN
(Address Sanitizer), which Address finds memory corruption
vulnerabilities like use-after-free, NULL pointer dereference, buffer overruns,
and so on that may not result in an immediate crash.

<summary>I'm getting 'You must have autoconf installed to compile libxml.'</summary>
Make sure you have autotools installed.  Try:
```bash
apt-get install -y autoconf automake libtool
```
and then re-run `autogen` and `make` as above. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>I'm getting 'syntax error near unexpected token LZMA,liblzma,'</summary>
Chasing down these sorts of errors is a real pain, but unfortunately part of any software analysis project!

While the problem looks like `lzma` may be missing, it's actually because
`pkg-config` is missing.  This is a bit more obvious if you read the
`./configure` source code where the error occurs.  

To fix, install `pkg-config`: 
```bash
apt-get install -y  pkg-config
```
and then re-run `autogen` and `make` as above.

## Create and build harnesses 

The core attack surface for any parser like libxml2 is the parsing logic
itself. The libxml library exposes the parsing function via the  [`parser`
API](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libxml2/devhelp/libxml2-parser.html) 

Try to identify which function to harness yourself.  (You can find the solution
in the next section if you are stumped.)

### Create the harness

Harnessing is just like any other test activity:
1. **Setup:** Call any routines needed to initialize the library. 
2. **Write test code:** Call the function you'd like to test.
3. **Teardown:** Call any needed teardown code.

Have you identified a function to harness in libxml2? Do you need to initialize
anything before calling that code?  What about teardown?

:::tip[Reading code bases]
As soon as you identify functions that you'd like to harness, start looking
through the code base for how those functions are used. That will help you in
the next step harnessing the code. 
:::



<details>
<summary>Solution: harness</summary>

The obvious candidate is `xmlReadFile`. This routine returns a base `xmlDocPtr`
object, and no additional initialization is needed. Further, if we create this
as a stack variable the object will be destroyed when our harness returns.

Here is a minimal harness:

```c title="test_xmlReadFile"
#include "libxml/parser.h"
#include "libxml/tree.h"


int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc != 2){
        return(1);
    }

    xmlInitParser();
    xmlDocPtr doc = xmlReadFile(argv[1], NULL, 0);
    if (doc != NULL) {
        xmlFreeDoc(doc);
    }
    xmlCleanupParser();

    return(0);
}
```
</details>

### Build the harness
After you've created the harness, you need to figure out how to build it. It's
completely normal for this to take some time if you're unfamiliar with the
build system. 

Can you figure out how to build the harness?

<details>
<summary>Hint: You need to use -I and -L</summary>
You should set the include path (-I) and library path (-L).  Here is a sketch:

```bash
afl-clang-fast  test_xmlReadFile.c <options> -I include -L .libs/ -o test_xmlReadFile -l <libs>
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Build Solution</summary>

Here is a working solution that instruments using 
```bash
# Working from inside the libxml2 directory
AFL_USE_ASAN=1 afl-clang-fast  test_xmlReadFile.c -O2 -I include -L .libs/  -o test_xmlReadFile -lxml2

# Alternatively, building with all clang instrumentation manually
afl-clang-fast  test_xmlReadFile.c -O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer \
    -g -fsanitize=address,fuzzer -fsanitize-coverage=edge,indirect-calls,trace-cmp,trace-div,trace-gep \
    -I include -L .libs/     -o test_xmlReadFile -lxml2
```
</details>


## Test harnesses locally

It's always good to try and run a local fuzzer before integrating into CICD and
running Mayhem remotely. 

Can you figure how to run the test harness with AFL++?

<details>
<solution>Solution</solution>
```bash
mkdir in out
cp test/attrib.xml in
afl-fuzz -i in -o out -- ./test_xmlReadFile @@
```
</details>

## Integrate into the build system

It's a good practice to integrate test harnesses into the code base directly so
that it's maintained with every other test.

libxml2 uses the autotools suite that drives the typical `./configure; make; make
install` process.  To integrate our harnesses, we will need to change
`Makefile.am` to include the harness. Can you figure out how? 

<details>

<summary>Solution: Integrating into Makefile.am</summary>

```diff lang="c"
- bin_PROGRAMS = xmllint xmlcatalog
+ bin_PROGRAMS = xmllint xmlcatalog test_xmlReadFile 
+test_xmlReadFile_SOURCES=test_xmlReadFile.c
+test_xmlReadFile_LDFLAGS = 
+test_xmlReadFile_DEPENDENCIES = $(DEPS)
+test_xmlReadFile_LDADD=  $(RDL_LIBS) $(LDADDS)
```

## Optimize performance

We can improve the performance of our harness in two ways:
1. Use AFL persistent mode. This should give you about 2x performance
   improvement. 
2. Use libfuzzer, an in-memory fuzzer. Libraries are great candidates for
   in-memory fuzzers.

Try to work out both solutions by yourself first. 

<details>
<summary>Solution: AFL Persistent mode</summary>

```c title="test_xmlReadFile_persistent.c"
#include "libxml/parser.h"
#include "libxml/tree.h"
#include <unistd.h>

__AFL_FUZZ_INIT();

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    #ifdef __AFL_HAVE_MANUAL_CONTROL
        __AFL_INIT();
    #endif
    unsigned char *buf = __AFL_FUZZ_TESTCASE_BUF;  // must be after __AFL_INIT

    xmlInitParser();
    while (__AFL_LOOP(1000)) {
        int len = __AFL_FUZZ_TESTCASE_LEN;
        xmlDocPtr doc = xmlReadMemory((char *)buf, len, "https://mykter.com", NULL, 0);
        if (doc != NULL) {
            xmlFreeDoc(doc);
        }
    }
    xmlCleanupParser();

    return(0);
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution: libfuzzer</summary>

First, you need to compile libxml2 for libfuzzer by setting the `CC` and
`CFLAGS`. Since this is a library, we want to compile with `fuzzer-no-link`
because there is no `main` function:

```bash
CC=clang CFLAGS=-fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link,address ./autogen.sh
make -j4
```

Second, create your harness:

```c title="test_xmlReadFile_libfuzzer.c"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <libxml/parser.h>
#include <libxml/tree.h>

void quietError(void *ctx, const char *msg, ...) {}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size)
{
    xmlSetGenericErrorFunc(NULL, &quietError); // suppress all error output
    xmlDocPtr doc = xmlReadMemory((const char *)Data, Size, "noname.xml", NULL, 0);
    if (doc != NULL)
    {
        xmlFreeDoc(doc);
    }
}
```

Now compile your harness:
```bash
clang -g -O2 -fsanitize=fuzzer,address ./test_xmlReadFile_libfuzzer.c -I libxml2/include/ libxml2/.libs/libxml2.a -lz -lm -o test_xmlReadFile_libfuzzer
```
