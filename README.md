## Getting started

To build this project, first make sure you have a current version of `node` and
`npm`, and then run:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
You can then see the documentation at `https://localhost:4321`.

*Format code*:  `npm run format`
*Build production code*: `npm run build`, which will output the code in `dist`.

Our documentation is built upon Starlight, which looks for `.md` or `.mdx`
files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route
based on its file name.


Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Here are some useful files to know about:
 * The sidebar is in `config/sidebar.js`.
 * Content is stored in `content/en/`, which is written in [MDX
   format](https://mdxjs.com/). MDX is just like markdown, and also allows you
   to use JSX in your markdown content. 
 * Translations are a WIP, and under `content/{ja}`. English is our default
   language. If a page is not translated, it will fall back to the english
   page.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
